1. Created First Server 
2.  Had a idea about event loop and node lifecycle 
3. got to know what is process.exit and why to not use it
4. understood requests and parameters such as - req.url, req.method, req.body
5. written code to send responses and learnt parameters - res.setheader, res.write, res.end
6. routed requests / redirected using if condition and strictly check operator (===)
 7. parsed req bodies by collectiing chunks --> combining them --> converting into usablle data
 8. after writing this whole code manually understood event driven code excecution depending on blocks/scope
